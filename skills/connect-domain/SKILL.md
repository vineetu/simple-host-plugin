description: Give a site already deployed on simple-host a nicer address — the user's own custom domain (subdomain e.g. recipes.brand.com via CNAME, or apex e.g. brand.com via A record) or a free <name>.simple-host.app (one call, active at once, no DNS). Use when a user wants their site served from their own domain or a short name over HTTPS. Optional, since every site already has its own address, https://<site>.<handle>.simple-host.app/, where visitor sign-in and private collections work. Drives the bind → DNS → verify → live flow; the agent does the API work and relays the two DNS records (the address record and a TXT ownership record) the human must add at their registrar.

# Connect a Custom Domain

**First rule: use the Simple Host tools when you have them.** If the Simple Host
connector's tools are available in this session (`who_am_i`, `list_sites`,
`create_site` / `update_site` (`deploy_site` on older connections), `get_state`,
`connect_domain`, …), use them for everything and never ask the person for an
email, a code or an API key — the connector is already signed in as them. Sign-in
itself is unchanged: when the person connects Simple Host in their AI app, a
Simple Host sign-in window opens, they sign in with Google or the emailed code,
then choose Allow, and every chat after that is signed in. If a tool reports the
connection is not signed in, ask them to reconnect Simple Host in their app's
settings. Only when those tools are not available (e.g. a coding agent without
the connector) use the email-code and API-key flow and the `X-API-Key` calls below.

Every site already has its own address, `https://<site>.<handle>.simple-host.app/` (the
`site_url` the API returns; briefly `https://<handle>.simple-host.app/<site>/` for a brand-new
account). Visitor sign-in (Google or an emailed code) and private collections already work there. This skill gives a site a nicer address: the user's
**own domain** — a subdomain (e.g. `recipes.brand.com`) or an apex (e.g. `brand.com`) — or a
free `<name>.simple-host.app`, served over HTTPS at the root. The site moves there and its
previous address redirects.

**Ask first.** Connecting an address moves the site there. Before any
`connect_domain` / bind call, name the site and the exact address and wait for a
yes. The same goes for disconnecting one and for any DNS change you make yourself.

## The free address: `<name>.simple-host.app`

No domain to buy and no DNS step. Offer this first when the person wants a short name and has
no domain. One call, once the person has said yes (with the connector: `connect_domain` with the
same value):

```
POST /v1/sites/{site}/domain
X-API-Key: <api_key>
Content-Type: application/json

{ "domain": "clay-studio.simple-host.app" }
```

It answers 200 with `"status": "active"` at once. Fetch `https://clay-studio.simple-host.app/`
to confirm, and you are done; skip steps 3 and 4 below.

- The name is one label: letters, digits and hyphens, not starting or ending with a hyphen.
- First come, first served. 409 `domain_taken`: another site has it. 400 `name_reserved`: kept
  for the platform (`www`, `api`, `admin`, …). 400 `invalid_name`: not a valid label. Pick
  another name and retry.
- It behaves exactly like a custom domain: the site is served at the root, its
  `<site>.<handle>.simple-host.app` address (and any older link) 302s
  there, and sign-in and private collections work there.
- Handles and free names share one namespace, so a free name cannot be someone's handle.
- `DELETE /v1/sites/{site}/domain` (with the connector: `remove_domain`) disconnects it. The
  name stays with the site: it keeps redirecting to the site's current address, and nobody
  else can claim it.
- A site has one connected address. Claiming a free name replaces a custom domain at once;
  connecting a custom domain replaces the free name only once the domain is live — until then
  the site keeps serving at the free name, which then redirects to the domain.

**This is agent-driven.** You do every API call and relay the exact DNS records. Then either
**add those records yourself** if you have DNS access for the domain (a provider MCP/API — see step
3b; ask permission first), or hand the human the two records to paste. Buying a domain (when
they have none) and — absent your own DNS access — pasting the records are the only human steps.

## When to use this

- The user asks to use their own domain / brand for a site.
- The user wants a shorter address than `<site>.<handle>.simple-host.app`. The free
  `<name>.simple-host.app` is the fastest route.

Sign-in and private collections do not need this skill; they work on the site's own address.

## Service

- Base URL: `https://simple-host.app`
- Auth header: `X-API-Key: <api_key>` (the key from deploying the site; not needed with the connector)
- One connected address per site (a custom domain or a free `<name>.simple-host.app`); an address can
  be connected to only one site.

## The flow

### 1. Confirm the site exists and pick the domain
The site must already be deployed (with the connector: `list_sites`). Ask the user for the exact domain they want, and confirm the site and domain with them before binding.
**Subdomains** (`recipes.brand.com`) are the simplest path (CNAME). **Apex domains**
(`brand.com`) are fully supported too — the bind returns an A record instead of a
CNAME. Prefer a subdomain when the user has no strong preference; use apex when
they want the bare domain.

### 2. Bind the domain
With the connector: `connect_domain` (it returns the same records, as `dns_record` and
`ownership_record`). Without it:
```
POST /v1/sites/{site}/domain
X-API-Key: <api_key>
Content-Type: application/json

{ "domain": "recipes.brand.com" }
```
Response (subdomain example — CNAME):
```json
{
  "domain": "recipes.brand.com",
  "status": "pending",
  "dns": { "type": "CNAME", "host": "recipes.brand.com", "value": "cname.simple-host.app" },
  "dns_txt": { "type": "TXT", "host": "_simple-host.recipes.brand.com", "value": "sh-0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef" }
}
```
`dns_txt` is the **ownership record**: a TXT record whose value is this site's own token. It
proves the domain is the person's. Nothing is verified and no certificate is issued without it,
and it must **stay in place** afterwards (the domain is re-proved with it; removing it makes the
domain fail its checks and, after three days, be disconnected). Relay the value exactly.
For an apex (`brand.com`), `dns.type` is `A` and `dns.value` is the IP to point at —
relay whatever the response returns; don't invent the target.
**www and the bare domain.** For `brand.com` or `www.brand.com` the answer also has
`partner_domain` (the other one) and `dns_partner`, its record (A for the bare domain, CNAME for
`www`). With that record added too, the partner forwards to the name chosen, on the same
certificate; the one TXT record on the chosen name covers both. `partner_status` says `pending`
(waits for the domain), `live`, or `not_set_up` with `partner_note` (not pointed here yet, or
another site on this server answers it). It is picked up automatically within a few hours once
fixed. Ask which one people should see (usually the bare `brand.com` or `www.brand.com`, as the
person prefers) and connect that one.
If the site already had a working address of its own (a free name or an earlier domain), the
answer also has `previous_domain`: the site keeps serving there until the new domain is live,
then that address redirects to the new one. Nothing goes dark in between.
`409` (`domain_taken`) means the domain is connected to another site **and that binding was
verified or has passed its ownership proof**. `409` (`domain_releasing`) means the domain was just
disconnected and is still being released; try again in 10 minutes. `400` means the domain is
malformed or is one of our own hostnames.

**A binding is provisional until DNS proves it.** Until its TXT ownership record is seen, the
bind is just a claim: another site can bind the same domain and take it over, and the claim
**expires after 24 hours** if DNS never points here (once the record is seen, it waits for its
certificate instead of expiring). `GET .../domain` shows `bound_at` and, while
unproven, `expires_at`. So do not bind days ahead of the DNS change — bind, get the record
added, and verify in one sitting; if the human can't add the record today, bind again when they
can (rebinding is cheap and idempotent for the same site).

### 3. Relay the DNS records to the human (their only task)
Give them both records, from the `dns` and `dns_txt` objects, in plain terms. Subdomain
(CNAME) example:

> Add these two records at your domain registrar (where you bought the domain), then tell me
> when they're saved:
>
> 1. **Type:** CNAME · **Name/Host:** `recipes` (the part before your domain — many registrars
>    want just the subdomain label, not the full name) · **Value/Target:** `cname.simple-host.app`
> 2. **Type:** TXT · **Name/Host:** `_simple-host.recipes` · **Value:**
>    `sh-0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef` (this shows the domain is yours; keep it in place)
>
> Leave your other records (especially MX / email) untouched.

For apex, use the returned A record (`Type: A`, host `@` or the bare domain, value =
the IP from the response) and the TXT record at `_simple-host` (the full name is
`_simple-host.brand.com`). Do not ask them to change nameservers or delete anything.
Only these two records are added, plus `dns_partner` when the answer has one (so `www.brand.com`
and `brand.com` both work; for `www` the Name/Host is `www`).

Ask which registrar (or DNS host) holds the domain's DNS, then give them that section's exact
menu path and fields from `references/registrars.md` ·
https://simple-host.app/v1/skills/connect-domain/references/registrars.md (Vercel DNS,
GoDaddy, Porkbun, and a generic section — including how to check the record landed at the
authoritative nameserver before trusting a public resolver).

### 3b. If you can edit the domain's DNS yourself, do it (with permission)
Instead of handing the record to the human, you MAY add it yourself **if you have a way to manage
that domain's DNS** (for example an API or an MCP server for wherever the domain is hosted). Work
out the current provider and the right tool yourself — those specifics change over time.

The records are the ones from the bind response: a **CNAME → `cname.simple-host.app`** for a
subdomain, or the **A record** for an apex, plus the **TXT ownership record** (`dns_txt`).
Rules (non-negotiable):

- **Ask the human's permission first**, naming the exact record you'll add. Never change DNS silently.
- **Add only those two records.** Leave everything else — MX/email, other DNS records — untouched.
- Apex **replaces** the domain's current root target, so only do that if the human wants the whole
  domain moved; otherwise use a subdomain, which is purely additive.
- No tool, or any doubt about what's safe to touch → just give the human the record (step 3).
- **Credentials are single-use.** If the user hands you a registrar API key, use it for the one
  write (and a read-back), then forget it. Never store it in the site, the repo, a config file
  or a message.

Ask which registrar hosts the DNS, then follow that section of `references/registrars.md` ·
https://simple-host.app/v1/skills/connect-domain/references/registrars.md — it has the
copy-paste API call (endpoint, auth header, body) for Vercel DNS, GoDaddy and Porkbun, plus the
per-vendor prerequisites (GoDaddy gates the API by account; Porkbun needs a per-domain "API
Access" toggle the human must flip).

Then tell them what you added and continue to verification.

### 4. Verify — fetch the domain
Fetching is the answer, and it's immediate:
```
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' https://recipes.brand.com/
```
- **200** → done. It's live. Go to step 5.
- **404** → DNS and the certificate are fine, but nothing is being served at that domain.
  Check the bind actually pointed at a site that has content deployed.
- **Connection/TLS failure, but `http://` returns 301** → DNS and routing are correct and only
  the certificate is missing. **This is not propagation — waiting will not fix it.** See below.
- **DNS doesn't resolve yet** → that genuinely is propagation. Re-check the record matches the
  bind response exactly, then retry over a few minutes.

The status endpoint (with the connector: `domain_status`) reports the same verdict — the server re-checks bound domains in the
background (every couple of minutes) by resolving them and fetching them, exactly as above:
```
GET /v1/sites/{site}/domain
X-API-Key: <api_key>
```
Returns `{"domain": "...", "status": "...", "certificate_status": "...", "verified_at": ..., "last_error": ...}`
(plus `previous_domain` while the site is still served at its earlier address).

- **`active`** — its TXT ownership record matches, the domain resolves to us *and* served a page over HTTPS. `verified_at` is when
  that was last proved. It is re-proved hourly, so a domain that breaks leaves `active` on its own.
- **`pending`** — not serving yet; `last_error` says what is missing:
  `add the ownership record ...` or `the TXT record ... does not hold this site's value` (the
  TXT record from `dns_txt` is not seen yet or has a different value — nothing else is checked
  until it matches), `domain does not resolve yet` (propagation, or the record isn't saved),
  `resolves to <ip>, not to this server` (the record points somewhere else — compare it against
  the bind response), or `resolves to this server; its certificate is being issued` (the DNS
  half is done; the certificate follows on its own, usually within minutes — see 4b).
- **`error`** — it resolves here and HTTPS works, but the site isn't served; `last_error` carries
  the code, e.g. `HTTPS returned 404`.

A domain you just bound reads `pending` until the first background check runs, so don't take an
immediate `pending` as a verdict — fetch, and re-read the status a couple of minutes later.

### 4b. The certificate
Nobody uploads or requests a certificate: once both DNS records are seen, the server asks for
one and the domain goes live on its own, usually within minutes. `certificate_status` shows
where it is:

- `pending` — the DNS records are not seen yet (step 3).
- `issuing` — the record is seen; the certificate is on its way. Wait a few minutes and check again.
- `live` — issued. If `status` is still not `active`, `last_error` says what the site answered.
- `failed` — it could not be issued; `last_error` says why and it is retried every few hours.
  The usual causes are fixable at the registrar: an IPv6 (`AAAA`) record for the domain that
  points somewhere else (remove it), or a CAA record that does not allow Let's Encrypt.
  `this name is already served here by another site on this server` means the name belongs to
  another site on Simple Host's server and cannot be connected; pick another name. Each account
  gets at most 5 new domain certificates a day; the next one says so in `last_error` and is
  asked for automatically once the day is over.

The www / bare partner (`partner_status`) follows the domain: `live` once it forwards,
`not_set_up` with `partner_note` when it does not point here yet or another site on this server
answers it. The domain itself works either way.

If `http://` redirects but `https://` fails, the DNS half is done and the certificate is being
issued — say so, rather than blaming propagation. (A self-hosted instance with its own edge
issues certificates however that edge is set up; the Caddy setup in `deploy/` does it on
demand.)

The redirect from the site's `<site>.<handle>.simple-host.app` address (and from the old
`<handle>.simple-host.app/<site>/` and old `sites.simple-host.app` paths) to the domain needs no
extra step: it starts once the domain is live and stops on disconnect.

### If a working domain stops working
The server keeps re-checking a live domain. If it fails every check for a day (the domain
lapsed at the registrar, or its DNS was moved), the owner gets an email with the reason.
After three days the domain is disconnected: the site serves at
`https://<site>.<handle>.simple-host.app/` again, and whoever holds the domain now can connect
it (with its own TXT ownership record). Fixing the DNS before then brings it straight back;
after, bind it again and add the TXT record again if it was removed.

### 5. Confirm it's live
Once `https://recipes.brand.com/` returns 200, it serves the connected site over HTTPS,
on its **own origin**. Sign-in and saves now happen on the domain: pages there sign visitors in
(Google or email code), and saves from a page need that sign-in. The site is still public: a
custom domain changes the address, not who can read it — sign-in gates saving, not reading; it
is not a private page. Private collections carry over and work on the domain; the
`website-deploy` skill's `references/backend.md` has the full flow.
From now on the site lives only on the domain: its `<site>.<handle>.simple-host.app/...` address
(and the old path addresses, which redirect too) answers 302 to
`https://recipes.brand.com/...` (same path and query), and the API there stops accepting writes
for it (401 `use_custom_domain`, even with a key — reads stay public).

### Disconnect
With the connector: `remove_domain`, after the person confirms, with the domain typed out as
`confirm_domain`. Without it:
```
DELETE /v1/sites/{site}/domain?domain=<the domain being removed>
X-API-Key: <api_key>
```
`domain` names the address you mean to remove; if the site's domain changed since you looked,
nothing is removed and the answer is 409 `domain_changed` (look again with GET). Unbinds the domain (the site stays live at `https://<site>.<handle>.simple-host.app/`, or, if
the domain was still pending, at the earlier address it was still using). A disconnected free
`<name>.simple-host.app` keeps redirecting to the site.
Disconnecting reverses both changes immediately — that address stops redirecting and
accepts saves again (the redirect is a 302, so nothing stays cached) — and any link people saved
to the domain simply stops working. Tell the user they can also remove the DNS record at their
registrar afterward.

## Backend on a connected domain

The per-site backend (shared JSON state, collections) works from the connected domain
**same-origin** — a page at `https://recipes.brand.com/` calls `/v1/sites/<site>/state` directly.
(The server ties the domain to its own site, so it can't be used to write to a different site.)
Writes here need the visitor signed in — Google (more providers later) or an emailed code,
just as on the site's `<site>.<handle>.simple-host.app` address: load
`https://simple-host.app/auth.js` and, because the site name cannot be derived from a
custom-domain URL, set `window.SH_CONFIG = { site: "<site>" }` before the tag, then
`await SH.requireSignIn()` before each save. The same page code works on the site's
`<site>.<handle>.simple-host.app` address.
Once a domain is connected, the site lives only there: its `<site>.<handle>.simple-host.app` page
URL (and the old path addresses, which redirect too) answers 302 to the same path on the domain,
and the API there takes no writes for it at all
(401 `use_custom_domain`, with the `domain`, key or not); `/me` there returns
`code: use_custom_domain` so `SH.mount()` shows "This site saves on <domain>. Sign in there to
save." with a link. Agents keep writing through the apex `https://simple-host.app/v1/...` with a
key, or through the domain's own `/v1/`. Disconnecting reverses both immediately. Pattern and API:
the `website-deploy` skill's `references/backend.md`.

## Gotchas

- **Add the two DNS records, don't replace anything.** Never touch MX/email records — whether
  the human adds them or you do it via an API/MCP. The TXT ownership record stays in place.
- **If you have DNS access, do it yourself — but ask first (step 3b).** Explicit human consent
  every time; add only the two records. No tool or any doubt → hand the records to the human.
- **Subdomain or apex.** Subdomains (`recipes.brand.com`) use a CNAME — simplest path.
  Apex domains (`brand.com`) work too via the A record returned by the bind. Prefer a
  subdomain when the user has no preference for the bare domain.
- **`status` tracks reality, but it lags.** The server re-checks bound domains every couple of
  minutes, so `active` means "resolved here and served over HTTPS", not "someone hoped so".
  Fetching the domain is still the immediate answer; read `last_error` to see which half is
  missing (step 4).
- **Users never upload certificates.** The server issues one once both records are seen (step 4b).
  `certificate_status: failed` comes with the reason in `last_error`; relay it.
- **`http://` 301 but `https://` failing is NOT propagation.** DNS is already correct; the
  certificate is on its way (`certificate_status: issuing`). Check again in a few minutes.
- **Propagation is not instant.** A domain that doesn't resolve at all right after the record is
  added is normal; give it a few minutes. Check the registrar's own nameserver first
  (`references/registrars.md`); a public resolver can hold the old answer for the old TTL.
- **A bind is provisional until DNS proves it.** An unproven binding can be taken over by
  another site and expires after 24 hours unless its DNS already points here (`GET .../domain`
  shows `bound_at` and `expires_at` while unproven). Bind and add the records in the same sitting; `409 domain_taken` only fires
  against a binding that was verified or passed its ownership proof.
