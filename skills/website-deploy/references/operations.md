# Versions, rollback, delete, analytics

All of these take `X-API-Key`.

## Listing

- **Sites:** `GET /v1/sites` — sites owned by the caller (admins see all).
- **Current user:** `GET /v1/me` — includes `handle`.
- **Versions of a site:** `GET /v1/sites/<sitename>/versions`.

## Rename

`PATCH /v1/sites/<sitename>` with `{"name":"new-name"}` renames the site and
moves its files. A connected custom domain stays attached. Links to the old
address keep working: they redirect to the new one (path and query kept) until
a new site is created with the old name. Use `site_url` from the response.

## Take a site offline

`PATCH /v1/sites/<sitename>` with `{"offline":true}` takes the site offline:
every address of it shows a plain "This site is offline" page, and visitor
saves (private lists too), visitors' reads of its saved data and lists, and
visitor sign-in are refused (403 `site_offline`). Use it when an event is over or a form must
stop taking entries. Nothing is deleted, and the owner's key still deploys,
reads and writes. `{"offline":false}` puts it back online; `GET /v1/sites`
marks an offline site `"offline": true`. Confirm with the person first.

## API keys: list, name, revoke, sign out everywhere

Each sign-in and each agent holds its own key. Keys issued now start with
`shk_` (older bare-hex keys keep working).

- `GET /v1/me/keys` lists them: `id`, `name` (`dashboard sign-in`,
  `agent sign-in`, `event account`, or a typed name; absent on older keys),
  `last4`, `created_at`, `last_used_at`, and `current` for the key you sent.
- `POST /v1/me/keys` with `{"name":"GitHub Actions"}` (not one of the names
  above, which Simple Host keeps for its own keys) mints a named key for a
  CI secret or another machine and returns `api_key` once. Add
  `"scope":"deploy"` for a **deploy-only** key (create, update, roll back and
  list sites, preview links; everything else answers 403 `deploy_only_key`),
  the right key for a CI secret (a deploy key can publish code that runs when
  you open your own site; treat it like the site itself), and `"expires_in_days": 90` (1–3650) for one
  that stops on a date. The list shows `scope`, `expires_at`,
  `idle_expires_at` and, once a key has stopped, `expired`.
- `DELETE /v1/me/keys/<id>` revokes one key; the others keep working. This is
  the fix for one leaked key: find it by `last4`, revoke it.
- `POST /v1/me/sign-out` ends the key you send (what the dashboard's Sign out
  does).
- `POST /v1/me/api-key/rotate` is **Sign out everywhere**: it returns a new
  `api_key`, every older key stops working immediately and connected apps
  (ChatGPT, Claude, Grok) are signed out, so update the agent or CLI before its
  next request.

The person sees and manages the same list in the **Keys** panel of their page
(`https://<handle>.simple-host.app/` while signed in). A 401 carries a `code`:
`missing_api_key`, `wrong_auth_header` (sent `Authorization` instead of
`X-API-Key`), `invalid_api_key` (revoked, signed out, or never valid: sign in
again for a new key), `key_expired` (past its chosen expiry) or
`key_expired_idle`. A key unused for 180 days stops working. For either expiry,
ask the person for a new key from the Keys panel; do not retry.

## Deploy from CI (GitHub Actions)

One call deploys whether or not the site exists yet: `PUT` with `?create=1`
creates it the first time and publishes a new version after that. Have the
person create a **deploy-only** key in the Keys panel (tick "Deploy only") and
save it as the repository secret `SIMPLE_HOST_KEY`, then add
`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (build first if the site has a build step, and
archive the build output, not the source):

```yaml
name: Deploy
on: { push: { branches: [main] } }
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: tar -czf site.tar.gz -C public .
      - run: curl -fsS -X PUT "https://simple-host.app/v1/sites/<sitename>?create=1" -H "X-API-Key: ${{ secrets.SIMPLE_HOST_KEY }}" --data-binary @site.tar.gz
```

`public` is the folder holding `index.html`. Without `?create=1`, `POST`
creates (409 `site_exists` if it exists: use `PUT`) and `PUT` updates (404 if
it does not).

## Rollback

Uploads are append-only. Rolling back re-points the active version at one that
already exists; it does not delete anything. It changes what visitors see, so
confirm the version with the person first.

```
PUT /v1/sites/<sitename>/active-version
X-API-Key: <api_key>
{"version_number": <n>}
```

There is **no** `.../activate` and no `.../version/<n>` endpoint. This is the one.

### Look before it goes live

To let the person see a new version before visitors do, deploy it with
`?publish=false` (on `PUT /v1/sites/<sitename>/files` or the archive
`PUT /v1/sites/<sitename>`). The version is stored but not made live; the answer
carries `unpublished_version` and `preview_url`, a link that works for anyone
who has it, for one hour, and shows that version exactly as visitors would see it. Give the
person the link. When they are happy, make it live with the `active-version`
call above. `POST /v1/sites/<sitename>/versions/<n>/preview-link` mints a new
link for any kept version (`GET .../versions` shows a stored, never-live one
as `"status": "ready"`). Pages opened from a preview cannot save (403
`preview_read_only`). A new site's first version always goes live.

### Reading an old version

Read a retained version's files (owner API key required):

```bash
curl -fsS "https://simple-host.app/v1/sites/<sitename>/versions/<n>/files" \
  -H "X-API-Key: <api_key>" -H "X-Skill-Version: 0.27.2"
curl -fsS "https://simple-host.app/v1/sites/<sitename>/versions/<n>/files/index.html" \
  -H "X-API-Key: <api_key>" -H "X-Skill-Version: 0.27.2"
```

The first call returns version metadata and files sorted by relative path with byte
sizes. The second streams the file with sandbox CSP. Pruned versions return 404.

## Delete and restore

```
DELETE /v1/sites/<sitename>
```

Takes the site offline at once, with every version, its state and collections.
It stays in Recently deleted for 7 days, then it is removed for good. Confirm
with the user in plain language before calling it, and say what goes offline.
Until it is removed its name stays taken: creating a site with that name answers
409 with `"recently_deleted": true` (ask the person whether to restore it). Offer
a copy first (Download a copy, below). A site the operator has taken down cannot
be deleted (403 `site_suspended`).

- `GET /v1/me/deleted-sites` lists them: `{"sites":[{"name","deleted_at","purge_at"}],"retention_days":7}`.
- `POST /v1/sites/<sitename>/restore` brings one back under the same name and
  address, with every version, its saved data and any connected address.

Connector: `delete_site`, `list_deleted_sites`, `restore_site`.

## Idle sites and Keep

On simple-host.app, a site with no visitors, no new version and no saved data
for 90 days gets its owner an email with a "Keep it" link (and a link to their
page, where they can sign in and download it); 30 days later with nothing done
it moves to Recently deleted, and a second email has a "Restore it" link. Each
link opens a page with a button that does the action. `GET /v1/sites` shows
`idle_removal_at` on such a site; a new deploy, a visit, a save or a restore
also clears it. Sites with their own domain or
claimed name, and sites taken offline, are never flagged. To keep a site up for good:

```
PUT /v1/sites/<sitename>/keep   {"keep": true}
```

(`{"keep": false}` clears it.) Connector: `keep_site`. The owner app has "Keep
for good" on each site.

## Change the handle (the person's address)

The person chooses their handle when signing up (see `register.md`).
`PATCH /v1/me` with `{"handle":"new-name"}` changes the `<handle>` in every
address. Before anything is published it changes freely; after that,
once every 30 days (429 with `next_change_after` otherwise). The old handle stays reserved
for the person and every old address redirects to the new one. What pages kept
in visitors' browsers (localStorage) starts empty at the new address, and
visitors sign in again, so tell the person before changing it. They can also do
it themselves under "Your address" on their Simple Host page. Afterwards re-read
`site_url` from `GET /v1/sites`; never compose addresses.

## Change the sign-in email; sign-in alerts

```
POST /v1/me/email         {"email": "new@example.com"}                      (X-API-Key) → 202, codes sent
POST /v1/me/email/verify  {"code": "123456", "current_code": "654321"}      (X-API-Key) → 200 {"email"}
```

The person reads one 6-digit code from the NEW inbox (`code`) and one from
their CURRENT inbox (`current_code`); both are needed (15 minutes, 3 tries).
Verifying moves the account there: codes go to the new address from then on;
the handle, sites and connected apps stay; every other key is signed out (the
one used stays). The old address gets a notice with a 7-day undo link.
Linked Google/GitHub sign-ins stay: `GET /v1/me/identities` lists them and
`DELETE /v1/me/identities/<id>` unlinks one (only when the person asks).
Refusals: 400 `not_an_account_key` (a connected app cannot do this; point the
person to "Sign-in" on their page), `same_email`, `invalid_email`,
`codes_required`, `no_pending_change`, `reserved_email`; 401 `invalid_code`;
403 for the reviewer, admin, event and preview accounts; 409 `email_taken`
(another account signs in with it).

After each sign-in or app connection the person gets a short email (time,
browser or app, a link to "Sign out everywhere"; at most one per browser a day).
`GET /v1/me` shows `signin_alerts`; `PATCH /v1/me {"signin_alerts": false}`
turns them off (own key only). Only change it when the person asks.
## Download a copy

```
GET /v1/sites/<sitename>/export.tar.gz          (X-API-Key)
POST /v1/sites/<sitename>/export-link           (X-API-Key) → {"url", "expires_at"}
```

The archive holds the live files (`<site>/files/…`), the saved state
(`<site>/state.json`) and every collection's items (`<site>/collections.json`,
private lists included). The link form (connector: `export_site`) opens the same
archive without a key for 10 minutes: give it to the person to click, never post
it publicly, and make a new one if it has expired.

Each entry in `collections.json` is `{id, created_at, submitted_by, data}`
(`submitted_by` only on private lists).

## The person's whole account: download or delete

```
GET /v1/me/export.zip                           (X-API-Key)
DELETE /v1/me  {"confirm": "<handle>"}          (X-API-Key; the email if no handle)
```

The first is one .zip of everything held about the person: every live site
(as above, under `sites/<name>/`), every site in Recently deleted (same layout
under `recently-deleted/<name>/`, with `deleted.json` saying when it goes for
good), `account.json`, `keys.json` (names only, never
keys), `connected_apps.json` and `visitor.json` (entries they sent to other
people's lists, and changes they made to other people's page data, while signed
in; writes made without signing in and older public-list entries are not linked
to anyone, so support@simple-host.app helps with those). The older address
`/v1/me/export.tar.gz` serves the same .zip. The connector's `export_site` covers one site; the whole-account archive needs the
person's own key (a connected app gets 400 `not_an_account_key`), so point them to
"Download my data" on their Simple Host page.

`DELETE /v1/me` deletes the account and all its data at once and for good,
including their entries on other people's lists; nothing goes to Recently
deleted. Only when the person explicitly asks to delete their account: say what
goes, offer the download first, and send their handle as `confirm` only after
they confirm. It needs their own key (a connected app gets 400
`not_an_account_key`); they can always do it themselves under "Your data" on
their page. A suspended account (403 `account_suspended`) or one with a site
the operator took down (403 `site_suspended`) cannot delete itself: point the
person to support@simple-host.app.

## Analytics

Every deployed site gets server-side visitor analytics automatically — page views
and unique visitors, hourly and daily, computed from access logs. No tracking
script, no cookie banner. IPs are hashed with a server-side salt and never
stored raw. `visitors` is unique visitors over the window asked for — the range
total is real uniques, not the sum of the daily numbers, so someone who visited
on five days counts once in `totals` and five times across `daily`.

Every count is split four ways by who was asking:

| Class | What it is |
|---|---|
| `person` | No automation signature — **this is the audience number** |
| `bot` | Crawlers, AI scrapers, SEO tools, security scanners, HTTP libraries |
| `infra` | Uptime probes and health checks pointed at the site |
| `unknown` | Days recorded before classification existed (before `classified_from`); cannot be broken down — never fold it into the others |

Report `person` when a user asks how many people visited. Never quote a combined
total: `infra` is typically an order of magnitude larger than real traffic (a
probe hitting `/` every 30s is 2,880 requests a day), so a total answers a
question nobody asked.

- The dashboard shows People / Bots / Infra side by side per site, with a
  24-hour bar chart of people and bots.
- API (owner only):

  ```
  GET /v1/sites/<sitename>/analytics?days=30
  → {
      range_days,
      classified_from,                                        // e.g. "2026-08-09"
      totals:   {person:{views,visitors}, bot:{…}, infra:{…}, unknown:{…}},
      last_24h: {person:{views,visitors}, bot:{…}, infra:{…}, unknown:{…}},
      daily:    [{day,  person:{…}, bot:{…}, infra:{…}, unknown:{…}}…],  // dense
      hourly:   [{hour, person:{…}, bot:{…}, infra:{…}, unknown:{…}}…]   // 24 buckets
    }
  ```

- Top pages and where visitors came from (people only; a referrer is its
  domain alone, never a full address):

  ```
  GET /v1/sites/<sitename>/analytics/top?days=30
  → { range_days, pages: [{path, views}…], referrers: [{domain, views}…] }  // top 20 each
  ```

## A nicer address: a free name or a custom domain

These live in the separate `connect-domain` skill
(https://simple-host.app/v1/skills/connect-domain). They are optional: every
site already lives at its own `https://<sitename>.<handle>.simple-host.app/`. In short:
`POST /v1/sites/<sitename>/domain` with `{domain}`.

- A free `<name>.simple-host.app` (`{"domain":"clay-studio.simple-host.app"}`)
  answers `active` at once. No DNS step.
- The person's own domain returns two DNS records for the human to add at their
  registrar: the address record (`dns`) and a TXT ownership record (`dns_txt`,
  kept in place); poll `GET /v1/sites/<sitename>/domain` until `active`.

The site moves there and its old address redirects. Sign-in and private
collections work either way: visitors sign in with Google or an emailed code on
the site's own address, and every save from a page needs a signed-in visitor
(see `backend.md`). Agents write with the site owner's API key.

## Private collections

Private Submissions: declare the name with `PUT /v1/sites/<sitename>/data/<name>/kind`
and `{"kind": "entries"}` (connector: `declare_data`; private is the default), and
`GET /v1/sites/<sitename>/data` (`list_data`) lists every name with its kind, its
settings and who may save. A name nobody declared is Shared (public).
`PUT /v1/sites/<sitename>/collections/<name>/privacy` with `{"private": true}`
(connector: `set_collection_privacy`) makes one collection owner-only: visitors
signed in on the site's own address add to it; only the site owner — and the
Simple Host operator, for moderation — can read it. Any site can make a list
private.
`{"private": false}` makes it public again, including everything already in it
(the submitters' emails, `_submitted_by`, stay visible only to the owner),
so confirm with the user first. The owner reads it with
`GET /v1/sites/<sitename>/collections/<name>`, lists all with
`GET /v1/sites/<sitename>/collections` (each entry has `private`), and downloads
`GET /v1/sites/<sitename>/collections/<name>/export.csv`. The owner edits or
deletes one item with `PATCH` / `DELETE /v1/sites/<sitename>/collections/<name>/items/<id>`
(in a public list the owner can delete an item but not edit it: 409 `append_only`),
and empties a whole list with `DELETE /v1/sites/<sitename>/collections/<name>` and
`{"confirm": "<name>"}`. Full flow: `backend.md`.

**Pages are always public.** There is no password-locked page. Every deployed
page is public to anyone with its address, on a custom domain or not. If a user
asks for a private page, say so plainly rather than suggesting a workaround.
Sign-in gates saving, not reading pages; only a private collection is
owner-only.
